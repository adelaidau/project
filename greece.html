    <ul>
        <li> Argo: Traditional greek food with spectacular view; recommended for sunset </li>
        <li> Catch Bar and Restaurant: Live music and great drinks for the night. Ask for the table in the 
            rooftop

    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <p>
    Mykonos is a small luxury island with very nice restaurants, shops, hotels, bars and views. It is a party island,
    where most restaurants are at beach clubs with dj's, drinks and a very young crew. The color of the ocean is 
    incredible and it contrasts with the town which is small but fits perfectly with the picture of Greek architecture.
    There are really nice shops but they are very expensive. The best plan is to go to a beach club during the day, stay
    at the beach, eat there and have some drinks and then go walk around town and have dinner there. 
    </p>
    <h3> Restaurant Recommendations </h3>
    <ul>
    <li> Scorpios: Very nice beach club with amazing food and drinks. Live dj performers and the best
        sunset. The days to go are Thursday and Saturday.
    </li>
    <li> Principote: Best vibes with the view of an amazing ocean and separating the restaurant between
        the party zone and the more formal restaurant zone.
    </li>
    </ul>
