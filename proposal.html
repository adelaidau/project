    <h1>Travel Blog</h1>
    <h2>My Website will be about my traveling experiences and I will highlight the favorite countries
        I have visited.
    </h2>
    <h3>The objective of my website is to highlight the favorite places I have traveled to around the world. 
        I want to show these places through pictures primarly and then give some recommendations for travelers
        who want to go there.
    </h3>
    <p> My target audience will be young people who love to travel all around the world and love to learn 
        about history and new cultures.
    </p>
    <p>
        I want each page of my website to be about one of my favorite countries. The homepage will have an overview
        of the countries I have liked the most and then once you click to an image of a specific country it will take
        you to a page for that specific country with recommendations for restaurants, tourism and other important
        information I found for someone who is interested in visiting these countries.
