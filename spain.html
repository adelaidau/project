<h2> Madrid </h2>

<h3> Overview</h3>
<p>
Madrid is the capital city of Spain and it is a city full of life. You will find the best restaurants and an amazing
vibe to go to different bars and clubs. If you stay in Salamanca you will be able to walk almost everywhere, and this
is the best way to get to know the city. Prepare for shopping the amazing Spanish style at a very good price and
a big tip is to ask for the tax free which they will return at the airport!
</p>
<h3> Restaurant Recommendations: </h3>
<ul>
    <li> Ten con Ten: Amazing vibes and the best food. Dress nicely and be prepared to have 
        some drinks accompanied by amazing Spanish food with a very broad range of options. 
    </li>
    <li> Amazonico: Brazilian restaurant that has the best meet and also the best vibes. The decoration of
        the restaurant is amazing and you will want to go to the Jazz Club, a bar right below afterwards.
    </li>
    <li> El Paraguas: Perfect to have lunch in the terrace and see all the people 
        walking around, enjoying the amazing weather and really good food.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2> Barcelona</h2>

<h3> Overview </h3>
<p>
Barcelona is personally one of my favorite cities. The architecture of the city is incredible and the city
also has the ocean right next to it and the mountains, meaning you have a lot of things to do in a very beautiful city. 
Walk by Paseo de Gracia and Rambla Catalunia, very nice streets where there are different types of shops and restaurants. 
</p>
<h3> Restaurant Recommendations: </h3>
<ul>
    <li> Cerveceria Catalana: The best place for small tapas and to go with a group of friends
        and order everything to share. The sangria is also a must!
    </li>
    <li>
        Merendero de la Mari: The best paella you will have and right in the port of Barcelona. You get
        really good food with an amazing view and amazing vibes. Walk around the port afterwards and you 
        will understand why the vibes of this city are insane!
    </li>
