    Travel Souls is a travel blog by Adelaida Urrea. I have always been very passionate for traveling since I was
    very young. My favorite thing about traveling is that you are able to explore different cultures, which I believe
    leads to a lot of inspiration and reflection of where you come from and what you want from life. It gives you
    a new and different perspective through once in a lifetime, unique experiences.
    </p>

    Some of these experiences come in different forms. I love eating in different countries and experiencing different
    types of flavors, which also reflect the culture. For this reason, before traveling I always research for the best
    restaurants with very authentic food. I do online research but also ask for recommendations from people who have 
    already visited these places or preferably locals.
